# PyCO2SYS-examples

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples/master)

Here you can find various examples of how to use [PyCO2SYS](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS).  You can view the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) files non-interactively here in the GitHub repo.  If you have installed Python and PyCO2SYS you could also clone or download this repo and run them locally.  Alternatively, you can try out the examples live in your web browser without needing to install anything at all through [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples/master).

Additional PyCO2SYS documentation is available at [PyCO2SYS.readthedocs.io](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io).

## Currently available examples

More are on their way!

  * [CO2SYSExample1](CO2SYSExample1.ipynb): calculate the sensitivity of DIC to pH and *p*CO<sub>2</sub>.  *Based on the original MATLAB example script **CO2SYSExample1.m**.*
  
  * [CO2SYSExample2](CO2SYSExample2.ipynb): converting conditions and pH scales.  *Based on the original MATLAB example script **CO2SYSExample2.m**.*

## Contributing

If you've got a great example of using PyCO2SYS that you'd like to share we'd love to add it here!  Just make a fork of this repo and push your additions back here directly into the *master* branch.  Please add a very brief summary of the example as a bullet point added to the list above.
