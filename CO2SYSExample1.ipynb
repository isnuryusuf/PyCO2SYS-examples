    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of the use of PyCO2SYS that uses its ability to process arrays of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generate a figure that shows the sensitivity of pH and *p*CO<sub>2</sub> to changes in DIC, while keeping everything else constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find further information about this way of using PyCO2SYS [in its documentation](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/co2sys_nd/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define input conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to define the input conditions that we want to use with PyCO2SYS. In this case, every input has a single constant value except for DIC (`par2`), which is a NumPy array of values increasing from 2100 to 2300 μmol·kg<sup>-1</sup> in increments of 5 μmol·kg<sup>-1</sup>:"
