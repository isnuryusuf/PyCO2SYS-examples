Then either click the Run button at the top or press ctrl+enter on your keyboard to run the selected section.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To the upper left of each code section you will see `In [ ]:`.  An asterisk (`*`) appears between the brackets while the code is running, which changes to a number once each section of code has successfully run.  Once it has been run (but not before!), the results calculated in one code section can be used in any other.  **Some sections do rely on earlier ones having been run, so make sure you run them all in sequence!**\n",

    "> You can edit the code freely and run it again to see what happens.  Don't worry, your changes are only local, so they won't affect anyone else.  If you close the notebook and start it up again it will all be reset (unless you've downloaded this and are running it on your own Jupyter server).\n",
